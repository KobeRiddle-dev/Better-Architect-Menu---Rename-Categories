# Better Architect Menu | Rename Categories

Renames all the verb category names so that all categories have nouns as their name.

Also renames certain other categories to be more consistent and understandable.

- Manage > Management

    - Produce > Crafting
    - Process > Processing

    - Naval > Sea

## Renames I'd like to make

- More (no rename)
    - More (the subcategory) > Misc. I'm not sure how to do this yet.
- Area > something else. I can't figure it out yet. Please share suggestions in the comments!
