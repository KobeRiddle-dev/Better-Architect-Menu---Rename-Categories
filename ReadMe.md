# Better Architect Menu | Rename Categories

Renames all the verb category names so that all categories have nouns as their name.

Also renames certain other categories to be more consistent and understandable.

## Renames

- Automate > Automation
- Build > Structure
- Entertain > Entertainment
- Fight > Security
- Furnish > Furniture
- Manage > Management
- Make > Production
    - Produce > Crafting
    - Process > Processing
- More (no rename)
    - More (the subcategory) > Misc
- Store > Storage
- Transport (no rename)
    - Aerial > Air
    - Naval > Sea

I also want to rename Area to something else, but I can't figure it out yet. Please share suggestions in the comments!
